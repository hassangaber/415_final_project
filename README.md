# ECSE 415 Final Project

* Our results can be found in: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zoSGYN4C08wdQuQMdOSitZcCGyDBgF-d?usp=sharing`

* Note: 
  1.  make sure to include `mcgill_drive.mp4` and `st-catherines_drive.mp4` inside a folder `data/` in the same directory as the notebook
  2.  Download the weights: 
      1.  `cd config/` then `wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights`
  3. All the code found in the scripts can also be accessed in the notebook under a slightly different format

* Execution

  1. `mcgill_drive`:
   
   ```
   ~$python3 mcgill_drive.py
   ```

  2. `st-catherines_drive.mp4`:
   
   ```
   ~$python3 st_catherine.py
   ```

  3. The results from the video detection from the scripts or the notebook will be in `data/`
